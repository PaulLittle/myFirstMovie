![Screenshot](img1.gif)

Holds details of Actors and the Movies they appear in.

Topics covered:

* Creating classes from which objects are made
* Working with collections (**ArrayList**) of such objects
* Surfacing this collection data to a **Listbox**
* Interacting with the **Listbox** (**SelectionChanged** event)
* Identifying selected item in the Listbox (**SelectedIndex**)
* XAML - GridSplitter
* XAML - rudimentary resource styling (to minimise repetition)

* Create **Movie** and **Actor** classes
* Create collection object to hold above
* Examine ways to create objects more effectively
* Use **ItemsSource** to hold content for **Listbox**
* XAML - **GridSplitter**
* Add stats line showing number of Movies and total number of Actors
